            <h4>What's new?</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>While you were using the beta version, some features have been developed that will make this addon easier to learn and simpler to use.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you click on the Pinned Microsoft To Do icon at your toolbar, instead of opening a new tab on the background, it now opens on the foreground (the current tab is changed to the app).</li>
                <li>If the app is already openned and you click on the Pinned Microsoft To Do icon again, instead of openning a new tab, it simply changes the current tab to the app's one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is also worth noting that the app url has been corrected because Microsoft has changed it recently. Now, instead of opening a welcome screen, you access "Your Day" list directly.</p>
